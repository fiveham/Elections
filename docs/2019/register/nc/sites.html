            <p class="heading">Sites with Voter Registration Forms in North Carolina</p>
            <p>DMV driver's license offices, public high schools, the Department of Social Services, WIC offices, public libraries,
               vocational rehabilitation offices, services for the blind, and services for the deaf and hard-of-hearing are required by 
               the NVRA (1993) to provide voter registration services; so, they carry voter registration forms and can return completed 
               forms to the appropriate county board of elections at no cost.</p>
            <p>County boards of elections and the state board of elections also carry voter registration forms and provide the same 
               opportunity to send in the form at no cost.</p>
            <p>One-stop voting sites (early voting) allow an unregistered individual to register to vote and then to immediately vote, 
               provided that the person registering 
               <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voters/Registering-to-Vote#item5_3" target="_blank">brings proof of name and 
               address.</a></p>
            <p>You can also register by mail by <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voter-Information/VR-Form" target="_blank">printing the 
               form</a>, filling it out, signing it, and mailing it to your county board of elections.</p>
            <p>If you want to provide voter registration forms to others, then 
               <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voters/Registering-to-Vote#item5_5" target="_blank">state-backed services for a voter 
               registration drive</a> may interest you.</p>
            <p class="heading">Note: Overlapping Sites</p>
            <p>In some cases, multiple NVRA sites are located at the same address, inside the same building, or otherwise in the same 
               place. In these cases, one of the sites is chosen to stand for all of them at that place. In some cases, this means that 
               a WIC office ends up hiding a county board of elections or that a library on the map conceals the presence of a DMV or 
               something.</p>
            <p class="heading">Note: Mobile Library and DMV Units</p>
            <p>Some of the library and DMV locations shown on this map are mobile locations that were associated with an address at the 
               original source of the data.</p>
