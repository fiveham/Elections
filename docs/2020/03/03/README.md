This directory holds both a traditional KmlLayer-based interactive election map and another version based on Data layers which can be dynamically recolored and whose infowindows can be dynamically rewritten.  The Data layer version is more useful for the upcoming primary election on March 3, as it allows candidate filtering by party.

As of late December 2019, the Data layer version is the canonical, prefered version.
