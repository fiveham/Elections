## US Elections - In Map Form

There are so many elected offices with so many different kinds and shapes of districts that the sheer volume of information involved can be a turn-off to potential voters. One way to resolve part of that is with multi-layered interactive maps of the districts and candidates (and sometimes polling places) for a given election. To that end, I've cooked up election maps like that for several elections.
