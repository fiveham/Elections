## US Elections - In Map Form

![NC Mar 3 map](https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/images/og/nc-03-03-2020.png)

There are so many elected offices and so many different kinds of districts with so many different shapes that the sheer volume of information involved in voting can be a turn-off. Multi-layered interactive maps of the districts and candidates (and sometimes polling places) for a given election are one way to smooth part of that steep learning curve. To that end, I've cooked up election maps like that for several elections.
