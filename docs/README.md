## US Elections - In Map Form

The plan is to populate this repository with single-state election maps for the off-year elections in 2019 and 2020 and if possible to do a countywide map for 2020.

For now, the only map available as part of this project is a single-layer map of outdated MS precincts with sometimes-incorrect polling place names and addresses: https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/2018/general/MS

Each state map should address

* State legislature districts
* Congressional districts
* Statewide offices on the ballot
* County/Parish/Borough-level offices
* Judges and other judicial positions (in applicable states)
* Polling places
    * Maybe even early voting locations
* Precincts/Wards/VTD districts

Other map information that would be nice, but which may not make it into final maps:

* How to register to vote
* How to vote absentee
    * Need an excuse?
* Early voting
    * Not available?
* ID requirements
    * None?
