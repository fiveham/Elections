## US Elections - In Map Form

The plan is to populate this repository with single-state election maps for the off-year elections in 2019 and 2020 and if possible to do a countrywide map for 2020.

Available maps:
* [VA state legislature. Primary June 11th 2019](https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/2019/primary/VA.html)
* [NC's 3rd Congressional District special election April 30th 2019](https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/2019/special/NC03.html)
* [NC's 9th Congressional District special election May 14th 2019](https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/2019/special/NC09.html)
* [Where and How to Register to Vote in NC](https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/2019/register/nc/sites.html)
* [MS precincts with polling place names and addresses](https://fiveham.github.io/Elections/2018/general/MS.html)

Each state map should address

* State legislature districts
* Congressional districts
* Statewide offices on the ballot
* County/Parish/Borough-level offices
* Judges and other judicial positions (in applicable states)
* Polling places
    * Maybe even early voting locations
* Precincts/Wards/VTD districts

Other map information that would be nice, but which may not make it into final maps:

* How to register to vote
* How to vote absentee
    * Need an excuse?
* Early voting
    * Not available?
* ID requirements
    * None?
